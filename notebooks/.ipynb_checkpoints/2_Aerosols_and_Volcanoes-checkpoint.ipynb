    "# 2: Impact of aerosols and volcanic eruptions on climate\n",
    "### PCS Day 2, Jan. 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now we've got a sense of how the climate system responds to a step-change of CO$_{2}$ and a steady \"ramp-up\" scenario (not unlike what we are experiencing now!), but in reality there is more to the atmosphere than just CO$_{2}$ concentrations!\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen in Philip and David's lectures earlier, both **human activity and volcanic eruptions** can have a marked **cooling effect** on the climate, by releasing **aerosols** into the atmosphere. (Aerosols are tiny particles of dust and pollution.) \n",
    "\n",
    "These aerosols scatter incoming solar radiation, causing a global *dimming effect* which can cool the planet and offset some of the warming caused by increased GHGs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This constitutes a short-lived, *negative*, radiative forcing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will use the `FaIR` model to investigate how the climate responds to these negative radiative forcing changes, and understand how they counteract some of the short-term impacts of CO$_{2}$."
