## Overview:

In these exercises we'll be using a simple, global-mean climate model to explore the sensitivity of Earth's climate to variations in greenhouse gases, aerosols and natural forcing (volcanic eruptions!). 

The model we're using is called the `Finite-amplitude Impulse Response` model, or `FaIR` for short. The FaIR model is a simple emissions-based, globally-averaged climate model. It allows the user to input emissions of greenhouse gases and short lived climate forcers in order to estimate global mean atmospheric GHG concentrations, radiative forcing and temperature anomalies.

For more information on FaIR, read the documentation and examples [here!](https://readthedocs.org/projects/fair/downloads/pdf/latest/)
